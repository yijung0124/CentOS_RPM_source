This database simply contains IP blocks as keys, and countries as values. This database should be more complete and accurate than using reverse DNS lookups.  This package includes GeoLite data created by MaxMind, available from http://www.maxmind.com/

rsyslog	8.24.0	(GPLv3+ and ASL 2.0)	rsyslog-8.24.0-16.el7_5.4.src.rpm	http://www.rsyslog.com/	Rsyslog is an enhanced, multi-threaded syslog daemon. It supports MySQL, syslog/TCP, RFC 3195, permitted sender lists, filtering on any message part, and fine grain output format control. It is compatible with stock sysklogd and can be used as a drop-in replacement. Rsyslog is simple to set up, with advanced features suitable for enterprise-class, encryption-protected syslog relay chains.
libdaemon	0.14	LGPLv2+	libdaemon-0.14-7.el7.src.rpm	http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/libdaemon/	libdaemon is a lightweight C library which eases the writing of UNIX daemons. It consists of the following parts: * A wrapper around fork() which does the correct daemonization   procedure of a process * A wrapper around syslog() for simpler and compatible log output to   Syslog or STDERR * An API for writing PID files * An API for serializing UNIX signals into a pipe for usage with   select() or poll() * An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected   to syslog.
iptables	1.4.21	GPLv2	iptables-1.4.21-24.1.el7_5.src.rpm	http://www.netfilter.org/	The iptables utility controls the network packet filtering code in the Linux kernel. If you need to set up firewalls and/or IP masquerading, you should install this package.
libsemanage	2.5	LGPLv2+	libsemanage-2.5-11.el7.src.rpm	https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux/wiki	Security-enhanced Linux is a feature of the Linux® kernel and a number of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to improve the security of the Flask operating system. These architectural components provide general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type Enforcement®, Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.  libsemanage provides an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary policies. It is used by checkpolicy (the policy compiler) and similar tools, as well as by programs like load_policy that need to perform specific transformations on binary policies such as customizing policy boolean settings.

kpartx	0.4.9	GPL+	device-mapper-multipath-0.4.9-119.el7.src.rpm	http://christophe.varoqui.free.fr/	kpartx manages partition creation and removal for device-mapper devices.
python-backports	1.0	Public Domain	python-backports-1.0-8.el7.src.rpm	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/backports	The backports namespace is a namespace reserved for features backported from the Python standard library to older versions of Python 2.  Packages that exist in the backports namespace in Fedora should not provide their own backports/__init__.py, but instead require this package.  Backports to earlier versions of Python 3, if they exist, do not need this package because of changes made in Python 3.3 in PEP 420 (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/).

Device drivers and filesystems are two examples of loaded and unloaded modules.

libffi	3.0.13	MIT and Public Domain	libffi-3.0.13-18.el7.src.rpm	http://sourceware.org/libffi	Compilers for high level languages generate code that follow certain conventions.  These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate compilation to work.  One such convention is the "calling convention". The calling convention is a set of assumptions made by the compiler about where function arguments will be found on entry to a function.  A calling convention also specifies where the return value for a function is found.  Some programs may not know at the time of compilation what arguments are to be passed to a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be told at run-time about the number and types of arguments used to call a given function.  `Libffi' can be used in such programs to provide a bridge from the interpreter program to compiled code.  The `libffi' library provides a portable, high level programming interface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer to call any function specified by a call interface description at run time.  FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function interface is the popular name for the interface that allows code written in one language to call code written in another language.  The `libffi' library really only provides the lowest, machine dependent layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.  A layer must exist above `libffi' that handles type conversions for values passed between the two languages.

libverto	0.2.5	MIT	libverto-0.2.5-4.el7.src.rpm	https://fedorahosted.org/libverto/	libverto provides a way for libraries to expose asynchronous interfaces without having to choose a particular event loop, offloading this decision to the end application which consumes the library.  If you are packaging an application, not library, based on libverto, you should depend either on a specific implementation module or you can depend on the virtual provides 'libverto-module-base'. This will ensure that you have at least one module installed that provides io, timeout and signal functionality. Currently glib is the only module that does not provide these three because it lacks signal. However, glib will support signal in the future.

Cpp is a macro processor which is used automatically by the C compiler to transform your program before actual compilation. It is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, abbreviations for longer constructs.  The C preprocessor provides four separate functionalities: the inclusion of header files (files of declarations that can be substituted into your program); macro expansion (you can define macros, and the C preprocessor will replace the macros with their definitions throughout the program); conditional compilation (using special preprocessing directives, you can include or exclude parts of the program according to various conditions); and line control (if you use a program to combine or rearrange source files into an intermediate file which is then compiled, you can use line control to inform the compiler about where each source line originated).  You should install this package if you are a C programmer and you use macros.
